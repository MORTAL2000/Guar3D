Next:
decouple Renderer from ECS.
provide Renderer with a scenegraph of its own.
GraphicsObjectCollection should provide weak ptrs not raw ptrs.
All resource collections should provide weak ptrs.

Graphics, ECS, Physics and Sound systems need their own scenegraphs.
write an abstract SceneGraph type?

---------------------
Later:

Physics system. Implementation handled by Bullet.

Finish forward renderpath
  Clean up ortho shadow caster
  Implement point light shadow caster
  Implement spotlight shadow caster

Start deferred renderpath

Add collision checks for lights, to prevent lighting through walls, reduce # of lights being
rendered etc.

Audio system. Will probably use OpenAL soft.

write lightbaking shader for static lights.

Next:
decouple Renderer from ECS:
provide Renderer with a scenegraph of its own.
GraphicsObjectCollection should provide weak ptrs not raw ptrs.
drawing should be handled via Graphics::draw iterating a graphics scenegraph collection, not done via the ECS (ForwardRenderer component).
All resource collections should provide weak ptrs.

Graphics, ECS, Physics and Sound systems need their own scenegraphs.
write an abstract SceneGraph type and SceneGraph collection type to handle the definition of behaviours.

---------------------
Later:

Physics system. Implementation handled by Bullet.

Finish forward renderpath
  Clean up ortho shadow caster
  Implement point light shadow caster
  Implement spotlight shadow caster

Start deferred renderpath

Add collision checks for lights, to prevent lighting through walls, reduce # of lights being
rendered etc.

Audio system. Will probably use OpenAL soft.

write lightbaking shader for static lights.

paralellize resource loading

review implementation LuaInterperter.cpp
derive LuaInterpreter for config file loading foreach system.

Once forward render ADSS is implemented choice:
 a) deferred path
 b) learn about c++11 threads. Refactor ECS and Graphics to be threadsafe (tight binding atm).
 c) fix include guard names, fix namespace names, fix forward decs and includes etc.

fix interface between graphics and ecs.
interface should be one way, it is 2 way.
camera and light must be changed.
refactor camera nad light stuff then encapsulate into ecs.
look at relationship between ECS::Renderer and Graphics::RenderObject. This is correct.

graphics <- ecs not grahpics <-> ecs

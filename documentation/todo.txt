Next:
Fix Game::PlayerController
 - implementation needs to be updated to work with Quaternions


Finish ECS::Rigidbody <-> PHY::Rigidbody interface.
 - abstraction for bullet collider types (box, sphere, etc.)
 - implement raycasting & resolving to weak ptr to ECS Rigidbody not the PHY body


---------------------
Later:

Physics system. Implementation handled by Bullet.

Finish forward renderpath
  Clean up ortho shadow caster
  Implement point light shadow caster
  Implement spotlight shadow caster

Start deferred renderpath

Add collision checks for lights, to prevent lighting through walls, reduce # of lights being
rendered etc.

Audio system. Will probably use OpenAL soft.

write lightbaking shader for static lights.

paralellize resource loading

review implementation LuaInterperter.cpp
derive LuaInterpreter for config file loading foreach system.

add projects to dependency solution for the dependencies that are missing (glew, glfw, bullet).
 - important for quickly building for different targets

implement findGameObject:
 what should the search procedure be? Iterative deepening depth-first search is preferred but Depth-first search would be easier to implement.
